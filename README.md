TestFolderEditableGrid
=========================

## Overview
This app is an editable grid of Test Folders. Rally does not currently allow the
Project field on a Test Folder to be edited, so this app was created to allow
you to do that. Just copy the html code into a Rally Custom HTML app. The app
respects project scoping.
